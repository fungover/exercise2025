- **entities/:** Player, enemies,items,tile?
- **map/:**  Dungeon grid,room,tiles -Dungeon generation and display
- **game/:** loop and input handling
- **service/:** combat and movement
- **utils/:** random number generation (maybe?)

## Key features

> - **Turn-based gameplay:** with command input.

> - **Procedurally generated dungeons:** with walls, enemies, and items.

- **Map symbols**: `@` = Player?, `E` = Enemy,`I`=Item,`â–ˆ` = Wall (uniCode
  U+2588), `.` = Empty

## Testing

### Use JUnit 5 to write unit tests for:

- [ ] Movement logic
- [ ] Combat calculations
- [ ] Item effects
- [ ] Map generation (basic validation)
