### Assignment
Exercise 3 – Java Programming: Warehouse Product Manager 
🧠 Objective Implement a small Java application for managing 
products using Java 8 streams and JUnit 5 for unit testing. 

The public interface will be a class called Warehouse 
in the service package. All public methods must be covered 
by unit tests. Use this projects code as a base and 
implement your solution in a branch. 

Pair programming is allowed. 

For joint commits, use the Co-authored-by: 
tag as described in GitHub's co-authoring guide. 

✅ Requirements for Pass (G) 
📁 Entities Create a Product class in the entities package with the following attributes: 
id: Unique identifier 
name: Product name 
category: Enum type 
rating: Integer (0–10) 
createdDate: Immutable creation date 
modifiedDate: Last modified date 

Use Java records or immutable objects to prevent external mutation. 
Avoid returning internal references like ArrayList directly. 

🛠️ Warehouse Functionality Implement the following public 
methods in Warehouse with corresponding unit tests (success + failure cases where applicable): 

* addProduct (Product product): Add a new product(validate name is not empty) 
* updateProduct(String id, String name, Category category, int rating): Modify an existing product 
* getAllProducts(): Retrieve all products 
* getProductById(String id): Retrieve product by ID 
* getProductsByCategorySorted(Category category): Products in a category, sorted A–Z by name 
* getProductsCreatedAfter(LocalDate date): Products created after a given date 
* getModifiedProducts(): Products where createdDate != modifiedDate 

Use Java 8 streams where appropriate. 

🌟 Requirements for Distinction (VG) 
Extend Warehouse with the following methods: 
* getCategoriesWithProducts(): Return all categories with at least one product 
* countProductsInCategory(Category category): Return number of products in a category 
* getProductInitialsMap(): Return a Map<Character, Integer> of first letters in product names and their counts 
* getTopRatedProductsThisMonth(): Products with max rating, created this month, sorted by newest first 

🧪 Testing Use JUnit 5 for all unit tests. 
Each public method must have: 
At least one test for successful execution 
At least one test for failure (e.g. invalid input)
